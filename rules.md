1. Respect the text channels and other users.
> This includes basic chat common sense. This is meant to be a mature community for Staff and Bot Developers in the Discord Community. Immature and malicious users will be removed promptly.

2. Impersonation is not tolerated.
> Any usernames not appropriate will result in a custom nickname being set
> Avoid offensive or otherwise annoying username/nicknames. If it's difficult to mention, don't use it here.
 
3. Do not violate the Terms of Service of Discord / Guidelines
> NSFW content, for example, can and will be punished severely.

4. Advertising as normal isn't allowed in our public channels.
> If you require help with your server in some way or someone to test your bot that's fine but handle that in DM and do not send invites unsolicited. 

6. Keep comments and discussion constructive
> Disagreements can and will happen, however, we will not tolerate posts that are severely out of line. Comments or posts that are not relevant to a topic will be deleted; Comments or posts that are extremely offensive or attack an individual or group may result in a ban.

5. We reserve the right to execute mod action as needed with and without notice.
> Typically no one should be a problem user but if you are clearly not here to contribute then you don't need to be here.
